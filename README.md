### Hey there, I'm Shaina! ðŸ‘‹  
Welcome to my little corner of the internet ðŸŒŒ

I'm a passionate tech Software Engineering Student exploring the exciting world of **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **Cloud Computing**. Right now, I'm sharpening my skills in **front-end development**, **UX/UI design**, and **AWS Cloud** â€” with a love for building sleek, responsive interfaces and smart applications that solve real problems.

âœ¨ **What drives me?**  
- Crafting beautiful front-end experiences with React and Tailwind  
- Exploring the limitless potential of AI and cloud technologies  
- Building scalable apps and testing workflows that just work  
- Learning, sharing, and collaborating with other devs and creatives

ðŸŽƒ Outside the code:  
Iâ€™m a horror & Halloween lover, cosmic dreamer, travel junkie, and a proud foodie whoâ€™s always hunting for the next great bite.

ðŸ’¬ **Letâ€™s connect!**  
Whether itâ€™s a front-end collab, a cloud-based side project, or just a shared love for spooky season â€” feel free to reach out and let's build something amazing together.
