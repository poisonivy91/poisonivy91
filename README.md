Hey there, I'm Shaina! 👋 Currently, I'm an apprentice in the exciting world of technology, focusing on Python and Machine Learning algorithms. I'm deeply interested in front-end development, UX/UI design, AWS Cloud, Python AI, and React. 💻✨ When it comes to my passions, I'm all about the wonders of tech and space. 🚀🌌 Additionally, I'm a huge horror and Halloween enthusiast, and I absolutely adore exploring different cuisines as a self-proclaimed foodie. 🎃🍴 On top of all that, I have a love for traveling and immersing myself in new cultures. ✈️🌍 I'm enthusiastic about collaborating with other developers and would be thrilled to work together on projects. Feel free to reach out and let's create something amazing! 💞👥
